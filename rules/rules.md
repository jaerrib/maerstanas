# Overview
**Mærstánas** is a free libre open source abstract strategy game where players alternate placing stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points between their own pieces.

## Objective
Players try to achieve the highest score by making the most number of connections.

## Components
- Game board
- _[Number to be be determined]_ stones or tokens, split evenly between two colors

## Setup & starting the game
The board begins empty (similar to Go). Players may decide which one goes first in whatever manner seems appropriate. Players then alternate taking turns.

# Playing the game
- On a player's turn, the player places one stone (_stán_) on a square on the game board.
- Stones (_stánas_) must be placed within the square, not on the intersections as in Go.
- Stones may be placed on any empty square, either standing alone or adjacent to another stone of either color (creating a _heorr_ or "hinge").
- Stones may only have **three** _heorras_; the fourth side *must remain free*.
- The edge of the board counts as **one** _heorr_; corners count as **two**.
- Play continues until no more viable moves remain.

# Scoring

- Players receive one point for each stone or edge adjacent to one of their own stones (_freóndlíc heorr_ or "friendly hinge").
- The player with the highest score wins.

# Credits
**Mærstánas** was created by John Beers.

It was conceived in 2022 while working on **Oferhlýp**. As a fan of Hnefatafl, I wanted to name my games using Anglo-Saxon words to lend a quasi-historical feel to them. Both **Mærstánas** and **Oferhlýp** utilize the same 7x7 grid because, if they _were_ historical, it might make sense for people to reuse an existing board, much like chess and checkers.

> The word _mærstánas_ is the plural form of _mærstán_, an Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word that means "a boundary-stone".
