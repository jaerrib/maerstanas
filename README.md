# Mǽrstánas

Primary development happens on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jaerrib/maerstanas) with [GitHub](https://github.com/jaerrib/maerstanas) acting as a mirror.

## Overview

**Mǽrstánas** is a free libre open source abstract strategy game. Gameplay involves players alternately placing stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points between their own pieces. Scoring is based on the number of these connections.

> Mǽrstánas means *boundary stones* in Anglo-Saxon (Old English).

## Project goals

My goal with **Mǽrstánas** is to build an engaging abstract strategy experience that is simple to learn while offering a level of complexity in mastering it. I opted to do this under an open source license because I am inspired by Linux and similar software and would like the game to be free (as in freedom as well as in beer) to all. I chose CC BY-SA because it's the most comparable to the GPL.

## Computer versions

Computer versions of **Mǽrstánas** are being developed in tandem with the board game. There are versions written using Python (with Django, Flask, or Pygame) and another written in JavaScript with HTML/CSS. Source code is hosted on Codeberg and mirrored on GitHub.
