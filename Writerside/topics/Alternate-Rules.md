# Alternate rules and scoring

## The wraparound rule ("Advanced Mǽrstánas")

- When considering hinges for edge positions, instead of counting the edge as a hinge, look at the position on the opposite side of the board.
  - For example, position A2 would only count a hinge if a friendly stone was placed at G2. Likewise B3 would need to look at B7.
  - Stones places in corners would need to consider both opposing corners.
- When the "wraparound" rule is in effect, edges are **not** automatically scored as hinges. Only true stone-to-stone hinges, including wraparound positions, are scored.
- Note: This rule may create positions that normally look unplayable. Care must be exercised when looking at edge plays.

## Simple scoring

When playing with the default / traditional ruleset, disregard scoring all edge hinges. This results in a lower scoring game but may make it easier for new or younger players to grasp scoring more quickly.
