# Overview

## About

**Mǽrstánas** is a [free libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) [abstract strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game) game by [John Beers](mailto:jaerrib[at]tutanota[dot]com).

It was conceived in 2022  while working on **[Oferhlýp](https://codeberg.org/jaerrib/oferhlyp)**. As a fan of [Hnefatafl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games), I wanted to name my games using Anglo-Saxon words to lend a quasi-historical feel to them. Both **Mǽrstánas** and **Oferhlýp** utilize the same 7x7 grid because, if they *were* historical, it might make sense for people to reuse an existing board, much like chess and checkers.


> The word *mǽrstánas* is the plural form of *mǽrstán*, an Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word that means "a boundary-stone".

## Objective

Players alternate placing stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points ("hinges") between their own pieces or the edges of the board in order to achieve the highest score.

## Components

### Required components

- Game board (*tæfl*)
- Approximately 40 stones (*stánas*) or tokens, split evenly between two colors

### Optional components

- 1 stone of each color marked in some manner (traditionally a *Þorn*, or "thorn" rune - ᚦ) to designate it as a *Þunor-stán* ("thunder-stone").
- 1 stone of each color marked in some manner (traditionally a *ós*, or "god" rune - ᚩ) to designate it as a *wóden-stán* ("Woden-stone").

## Setup and starting the game

The board begins empty (similar to Go). Traditionally, the player using the darker colored stones would play first, but players may decide who goes first in whatever manner seems appropriate. Players then alternate taking turns.
