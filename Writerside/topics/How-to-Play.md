# How to Play

- On a player's turn, the player places one stone (*stán*) on a square on the game board.
- Stones (*stánas*) must be placed within the square, not on the intersections as in Go.
- Stones may be placed on any empty square, either standing alone or adjacent to another stone of either color (creating a *heorr* or "hinge").

## Placement limitations

- Stones may have no more than **three** hinges; the fourth side *must always remain free*.
- Stones may not be placed such that four hinges are created immediately.
- The edge of the board counts as **one** hinge; corners count as **two** because they border two edges.
- Play continues until no more viable moves remain.

## Thunder-stone rules

- Players each have **one** thunder-stone (*Þunor-stán*), which may be placed on the board during their turn **instead of a regular stone**.
- Thunder-stones are the exception to the four hinge limitation. This is because, when placed, a thunder-stone removes any and all stones orthogonally adjacent to its position, whether they belong to the player or the opponent.
- Stones which have been removed from the board are returned to the respective players and do not count as captures or contribute to scoring in any way.
- After placement, thunder-stones hinges and scoring are treated the same as normal stones.

## Woden-stone rules

- Players each have **one** Woden-stone (*wóden-stán*), which may be placed on the board during their turn **instead of a regular stone**.
- Unlike standard and thunder-stones, which are placed on an open square, players use the Woden-stone to **replace** one of their opponent's stones already on the board.
- Being able to swap out an opponent's stone can create unique scoring and blocking opportunities, so waiting to use the Woden-stone until later in the game may offer greater strategic advantage.
- After placement, Woden-stones are scored the same as normal stones.
