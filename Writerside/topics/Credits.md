**Mǽrstánas** was created by [John Beers](mailto:jaerrib[at]tutanota[dot]com).

It was conceived in 2022 while working on **[Oferhlýp](https://codeberg.org/jaerrib/oferhlyp)**. As a fan of Hnefatafl, I wanted to name my games using Anglo-Saxon words to lend a quasi-historical feel to them. Both **Mǽrstánas** and **Oferhlýp** utilize the same 7x7 grid because, if they *were* historical, it might make sense for people to reuse an existing board, much like chess and checkers.

> The word *mǽrstánas* is the plural form of *mǽrstán*, an Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word that means "a boundary-stone".

Special thanks to my cousins, Caleb, Jerome, and Jesse, for play testing and coming up with the Advanced Mǽrstánas rule.
